 DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES:
--------------------------------
Do not use any of the files in or under this folder 
unless you understand the consequences of doing so 
and are comfortable with the possibility of losing 
everything in your indexer. If you come to IRC ask-
ing for help because everythings gone you will get
none. THIS IS FOR DEVELOPMENT TESTING ONLY!

PLACING THIS FOLDER
-------------------
Place all the files in this repo into misc/testing/innodb.
You can do this by:

* cd /path/to/your/newznab/misc/testing/
* git clone git://github.com/itandrew/Newznab-InnoDB-Dropin.git innodb

BUGS
-----
If you find bugs... please please please report them to me so I can 
fix them. There has already been a few I've fixed before this initial 
commit. So do expect bugs and do report so I can fix them.

WHATS ACTUALLY CHANGED
----------------------
Despite there being a large number of files in this
folder, only a few files have changed. The files are
nzb-import.php, lib/framework/db.php, lib/innodb/bac
kfill.php, and lib/innodb/binaries.php. For your conv
enience I have included the convertToInnodDB.php. So
why so many other files? Some of the refactoring part-
icularly in the binaries.php may not be compatible w-
ith the rest of the codebase. So I've included (and 
stripped down) the include files used so this code c-
ould be isolated from the rest. As such there should
be no problems with the site and the only possibility
for interaction problems would be in the database ent-
ries.  Keep in mind I could be wrong.  But I don't th-
ink so.

I KNOW THE RISKS/AM COOL WITH DEBUGGING
---------------------------------------
Awesome.  First thing to do is convert the parts
and binary tables in your db to use InnoDB. To do
that execute `php lib/innodb/convertToInnoDB.php`
PLEASE NOTE: Depending on the size of your exisi-
ting tables this could take a while. Let the scri-
pt finish and do its thing.  

I HAVE AN INNODB PARTS AND BINARIES NOW WHAT?
---------------------------------------------
Now you can use the nzb-import.php to import .nzb
files into your tables. update_binaries should be
used instead of the one under the update_scripts 
folder.  The same goes for backfill.php.  You will
probably want to modify your own screen script to
make use of these files in an automatic type way.

UPDATING RELEASES
-----------------
Update releases works the same as it did before.
Use the old script to run update releases. I've 
done nothing to improve its performance yet.
